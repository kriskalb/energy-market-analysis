# Futures Contracts Analysis Project
## Overview

### This project focuses on analyzing historical futures contracts data. The dataset was extracted from a database using advanced SQL queries. The main objectives of this project include:

    Determining the range of price differences (spread) between front-month (M+1) and the following month (M+2) contracts and investigating the seasonality of this range.
    Identifying periods when the price difference between M+1 and M+2 contracts was statistically inflated or deflated, providing investment opportunities.
    Generating BUY/SELL signals for individual contracts and/or pairs of contracts (transactions at the same time â€“ calendar spreads).

### The analysis involves utilizing various libraries including pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, xgboost, and prophet, along with SQL for data extraction.
## Project Goals

The primary goals of this project are:

    To conduct in-depth analysis of historical futures contracts data.
    To identify patterns and dependencies between different contract months.
    To develop trading strategies based on the identified patterns and price differentials.

## Main Features

Key components of this project include:

    Data Preprocessing: Comprehensive cleaning and preprocessing of the dataset to ensure quality data for analysis.
    Statistical Analysis: Analyzing price differences between different contract months and identifying statistical anomalies.
    Signal Generation: Generating trading signals (BUY/SELL) based on the analyzed data.
    Visualization: Utilizing matplotlib and seaborn for visualizing data trends and patterns.

## Technologies Used

This project makes use of the following libraries and technologies:

    Python: Primary programming language for data analysis and modeling.
    pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.
    matplotlib and seaborn: Data visualization.
    xgboost: Machine learning for predictive modeling.
    prophet: Time series analysis.
    SQL: Data extraction from the database.

## Installation Instructions

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

    Clone the repository: git clone 'https://github.com/your-username/futures-contracts-analysis'
    Navigate to the project directory: cd futures-contracts-analysis
    Install the required Python packages: pip install -r requirements.txt
    Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to perform analysis and generate signals.
    Due to the large size of datasets, download them from [insert dataset source] and place them in the appropriate directory within the project.

It is recommended to run the project in Google Colab for easier access to computational resources.
